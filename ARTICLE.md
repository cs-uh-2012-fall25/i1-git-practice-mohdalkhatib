## Why I Found It Interesting  
This article caught my attention because it highlights a critical tension in modern software development:  
as organizations rush to embrace **AI-powered coding tools**, they risk sacrificing **quality and stability**.  

What I found most interesting is how the piece emphasizes that without proper **testing, oversight, and accountability**,  
teams can accumulate technical debt and even face costly outages — yet still be judged successful by *speed metrics*.  

It’s a strong reminder that in today’s **AI-driven era**, software quality should remain as important as velocity.
